Do you want to continue to live in fear that one day your child would be arrested and you'd have to start running from pillar to post to make sure they don't suffer the inhumane conditions of the Nigerian police cell? 
Do you want to continue to part with the money you have worked so hard for to pay for bail for non-existent offences? 
Do you want to continue to work yourself into the ground trying to get your children out of Nigeria because you know that they are not safe here?

Nobody wants any of these. Please support our calls for a total #EndToPoliceBrutality in Nigeria.

This is one of many young people whose lives have been cut short.

Mainstream media is not carrying the news as it ought to, and a large number of them are spreading the wrong message. We are aware a lot of our parents are not on social media so we are sending this to keep you in the loop. That is why we are appealing to you to help us #EndSars now before it gets too late. 

Support us by calling those you know in power to #EndSars and put and #EndToPoliceBrutality

                                        <pre>At 10:00 pm on 20th October 2020, at least 11 people were confirmed dead and many more injured in a massacre orchestrated by the Nigerian Government.

This was the culmination of a string of events that started at 12pm, when the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, declared a 24-hr curfew in the state, only 4 hours before the curfew would sweep into effect. 

Shortly after the announcement, some unidentified individuals arrived at Lekki-Tollgate to remove the security cameras claiming they were sent by the government. As evening drew, the lights at the toll-gate where the protesters sat were turned off. Soon after, THE NIGERIAN ARMY ARRIVED AND STARTED SHOOTING LIVE AMMUNITION AT THE PROTESTERS. This was all streamed live on Instagram. We saw pictures and videos of our friends, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, singing the National Anthem to keep hope alive as they ducked in fear. We watched in horror as people fell and drew their last breaths. We saw the Nigerian flag covered with the blood of a Nigerian citizen, spilled by the army that should have protected them!

Ambulances were prohibited from the location. The official Lagos state Emergency lines were disabled and cell towers were said to be turned off. Army officials were also reported to be carting away the bodies of the victims.

Reports have tried to tag the killers as “Armed men” and the protesters as thugs. THIS IS A LIE. These protesters were not violent and were not thugs!

It is obvious the government is not prepared to ban the rogue squad. Even with the announcements made, we still see SARS harassing and killing people. AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS JOINED THEM!

We understand that many of you might not be able to join the youths to actively fight this, but we urge you to forward this to your contacts. WE NEED TO FIGHT IT NOW BEFORE WE ALL BECOME CASUALTIES.
